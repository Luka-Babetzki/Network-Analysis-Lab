## Steps

### Scenario

A SOC Analyst at Umbrella Corporation is going through SIEM alerts and sees the alert for connections to a known malicious domain. The traffic is coming from Sara’s computer, an Accountant who receives a large volume of emails from customers daily. Looking at the email gateway logs for Sara’s mailbox there is nothing immediately suspicious, with emails coming from customers. Sara is contacted via her phone and she states a customer sent her an invoice that had a document with a macro, she opened the email and the program crashed. The SOC Team retrieved a PCAP for further analysis.
