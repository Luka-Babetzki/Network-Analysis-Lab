# Network Analysis Lab

_**Source:** https://blueteamlabs.online/home/challenge/network-analysis-malware-compromise-e882f32908_

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to investigate a suspected malware compromise by analysing a network capture (PCAP) file. The scenario involves identifying how an infection occurred, tracing the command-and-control communication, and uncovering the delivery and payload mechanisms used in the attack. This exercise simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow in responding to malware-related alerts, with a focus on network forensics and threat hunting.

## Steps

### Scenario

A SOC Analyst at Umbrella Corporation is going through SIEM alerts and sees the alert for connections to a known malicious domain. The traffic is coming from Saraâ€™s computer, an Accountant who receives a large volume of emails from customers daily. Looking at the email gateway logs for Saraâ€™s mailbox there is nothing immediately suspicious, with emails coming from customers. Sara is contacted via her phone and she states a customer sent her an invoice that had a document with a macro, she opened the email and the program crashed. The SOC Team retrieved a PCAP for further analysis.

### 1. Wireshark

#### 1.1 Preliminary Analysis

I began the analysis by opening the provided PCAP file in Wireshark and navigating to **Statistics > Capture File Properties**. This gave me an overview of the capture timeline. 

- First packet: 2018-11-27 08:30:12 UTC
- Last packet: 2018-11-27 09:12:16 UTC
- Total capture duration: ~42 minutes

_(Note: Verifying the timeframe early in the investigation is best practise when confirming that the PCAP was relevant to the suspected activity window)_

Next, I examined the protocol hierarchy via **Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy**. This view allowed me to identify which network protocols were present and their proportional usage across the capture. Itâ€™s a useful step to identify unexpected or suspicious protocols that might indicate malicious behavior.

To better understand the key communication flows in the traffic, I looked at **Statistics > Conversations > IPv4**, sorting the results by byte count in descending order. This revealed that the internal host 10.11.27.101 was communicating primarily with three external IP addresses: 

- 95.181.198.231
- 176.32.33.108
- 83.166.247.211

These addresses became the focus of my subsequent investigation.

#### 1.2 Investigation

First, I focused on IP address `95.181.198.231`. On the Packet List Pane, I noticed that packet 1 contained a DNS request to a domain called: klychenogg.com, followed by a DNS response in packet 2 that refers to the same IP address and domain name. Next, I searched VirtusTotal for this domain name, revealing that 10 vendors had flagged this domain as malicious. By using a follow up search using the IP address, I found no malicious indicators however revealing that the IP is registered in Russia. _(Note. This can be an indicator of suspicious activity if the client, who this PCAP file belongs to, does not do business with Russia)_

I decided to dig deeper and search for the first HTTP GET request from the `95.181.198.231` IP address by **Right-clicking Packet 6 > Follow > HTTP Stream**. This revealed a HTTP GET request for the file: `spet10.spr` which contained a `MZ header` displaying: "This program cannot be run in DOS mode". This is a clear indication of a portable executable, most likely a .exe, and could suggest potential malware delivery. _(Note. MZ marks a file as a DOS-compatible executable. Despite modern .exe files being portable executables, they still use MZ headers for backward compatability)_

To narrow the scope, I applied a HTTP filter associated with `95.181.198.231`, displayed as: `(_ws.col.protocol=="HTTP")&&(ip==95.181.198.231)`. This results in only two packets, with packet 911 showing another GET request; this time for a `.rar file`. While the packet contained no damning activity, I made note of the timestamp in case it was required later.


Next, I shifted my focus to the second external IP address: `176.32.33.108`. I applied the filter `ip.addr==176.32.33.108`. In initial packets displayed the expected TCP handshake (SYn, SYN-ACK, ACK), followed by a GET request for a resource under `/images`. Following the HTTP stream revealed that the host domain was `cochrimato.com`. A VirusTotal showed this domain had been flagged as malicious by 7 vendors. _(Note. Although the IP itself was clean, it was also registered in Russia)_

Finally, I investigated the third IP address of `83.166.247.211`, using the same `ip.addr` filter. This IP also showed a clean TCP handshake, followed immediately by a TLS Client Hello in packet 757. Within this handshake, I extracted the Server Name Indication `(SNI) field`, which revealed the domain `mautergase.com`. I reviewed this domain and IP on VirusTotal; both were flagged by 2 vendors each and also appeared to be hosted in Russia. To broaden my view, I right-clicked the handshake field in packet 757 and prepared a display filter to view all Client Hello messages throughout the capture.

#### 1.3 Event Timeline and Observations

Below is a timeline of key events observed during the investigation. The "Tag" column uses emojis to distinguish activity between the three suspicious IP addresses for easier visual correlation.
